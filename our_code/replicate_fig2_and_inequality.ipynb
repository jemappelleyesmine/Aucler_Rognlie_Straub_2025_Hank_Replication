    "In models with household heterogeneity, it is important to explain why some households save a great deal while others save very little. In real data, we observe that a small fraction of households holds a very large share of total wealth, while many households have almost no savings. At the same time, households with little wealth tend to spend a larger fraction of any extra income they receive. A good model must therefore generate:\n",
    "- Sufficiently high total wealth in the economy,\n",
    "- High marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) for households with low wealth, and\n",
    "- A realistic amount of wealth inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing all three at once is surprisingly difficult. To address this, the paper adopts a simple but powerful idea: different households value the future differently. In other words, some households are naturally more patient than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model assumes that households come in two “patience types,” which correspond to two different values of the discount factor β:\n",
    "- Patient households have a discount factor close to 1. They value the future almost as much as the present, so they tend to save a lot and become wealthy.\n",
    "- Impatient households have a noticeably lower discount factor. They care more about today than tomorrow, so they save much less and often hold very little wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple distinction helps the model reproduce both high aggregate wealth (because patient households save heavily) and high MPCs (because impatient households have little buffer and spend most of their income).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model assumes that in the long run, a certain fraction of households will be patient and the rest impatient. This long-run share is denoted by ω (omega). For example, if ω = 0.49, then about 49% of households will be patient in steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid treating patience type as a fixed lifelong characteristic, the model introduces a small probability that a household’s type may change. Specifically, each period, with probability q, a household receives a new “type draw” from the long-run distribution. This process can be interpreted as generational turnover: old households exit and new ones enter, inheriting characteristics randomly according to the stable distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "When q is small, here, q = 0.01—such changes are rare. On average, a household keeps its type for many years, which helps the model generate persistent differences in wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows the model to simultaneously match realistic wealth inequality, high MPCs among low-wealth households, and a high overall level of wealth in the economy. Patient households accumulate substantial savings, while impatient households remain close to hand-to-mouth. The occasional type switching prevents the economy from splitting permanently into two non-interacting groups and helps stabilize the wealth distribution over time."
