    "In models with household heterogeneity, it is important to explain why some households save a great deal while others save very little. In real data, we observe that a small fraction of households holds a very large share of total wealth, while many households have almost no savings. At the same time, households with little wealth tend to spend a larger fraction of any extra income they receive. A good model must therefore generate:\n",
    "- Sufficiently high total wealth in the economy,\n",
    "- High marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) for households with low wealth, and\n",
    "- A realistic amount of wealth inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing all three at once is surprisingly difficult. To address this, the paper adopts a simple but powerful idea: different households value the future differently. In other words, some households are naturally more patient than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model assumes that households come in two “patience types,” which correspond to two different values of the discount factor β:\n",
    "- Patient households have a discount factor close to 1. They value the future almost as much as the present, so they tend to save a lot and become wealthy.\n",
    "- Impatient households have a noticeably lower discount factor. They care more about today than tomorrow, so they save much less and often hold very little wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple distinction helps the model reproduce both high aggregate wealth (because patient households save heavily) and high MPCs (because impatient households have little buffer and spend most of their income).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model assumes that in the long run, a certain fraction of households will be patient and the rest impatient. This long-run share is denoted by ω (omega). For example, if ω = 0.49, then about 49% of households will be patient in steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid treating patience type as a fixed lifelong characteristic, the model introduces a small probability that a household’s type may change. Specifically, each period, with probability q, a household receives a new “type draw” from the long-run distribution. This process can be interpreted as generational turnover: old households exit and new ones enter, inheriting characteristics randomly according to the stable distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "When q is small, here, q = 0.01—such changes are rare. On average, a household keeps its type for many years, which helps the model generate persistent differences in wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows the model to simultaneously match realistic wealth inequality, high MPCs among low-wealth households, and a high overall level of wealth in the economy. Patient households accumulate substantial savings, while impatient households remain close to hand-to-mouth. The occasional type switching prevents the economy from splitting permanently into two non-interacting groups and helps stabilize the wealth distribution over time."

    "In addition to long-run income differences, households in the model are also affected by the business cycle. When the economy expands and employment rises, most households earn more. When the economy contracts, earnings fall. However, not all households experience these changes in the same way. Some may be hit harder during a recession, while others may see their incomes hardly change at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the income() function is to determine each household’s income in a way that allows the model to explore different assumptions about how unevenly economic fluctuations are shared across the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a basic level, each household’s labor income is the product of two components:\n",
    "- Its individual productivity, represented in the code by e_grid, and\n",
    "- The aggregate wage bill in the economy, represented by wN_aftertax.\n",
    "\n",

    "The simplest version of the model would assume that every household’s income rises or falls in exact proportion to the aggregate economy. But real-world data show that this is not the case: recessions typically hit low-income workers harder, and booms tend to benefit higher-productivity workers more. The model allows us to capture this type of unequal exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is embodied in the parameter ζ (zeta), which adjusts how sensitive each household’s income is to changes in aggregate employment:\n",
    "- When ζ = 0, all households experience the business cycle in the same proportion.\n",
    "This is the “neutral” case.\n",
    "- When ζ < 0, households with low productivity are hit harder during recessions and benefit less during expansions.\n",

    "This corresponds to procyclical equality, which is less typical but useful to study.\n",
    "\n",
    "The income() function provides a flexible way to model how households’ incomes respond to the business cycle. It allows the researcher to test different assumptions about how recessions and expansions affect low-income and high-income households, and it incorporates optional tax changes on the richest group for specific policy experiments. This flexibility is important because differences in income risk and exposure to shocks can significantly influence saving behavior, spending responses, and ultimately the macroeconomic effects the model aims to study."

    "Before simulating policy experiments or dynamic responses, the model must be anchored in a steady state—a situation in which the economy is stable and all variables remain constant over time. The steady state serves as a reference point from which shocks are introduced and against which results are interpreted. This section describes how the notebook constructs the key steady-state values that are shared across all model variants (heterogeneous agents, two-agent, and representative agent).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code defining these values begins with:\n",
    "- Y = 1\n",
    "- r = 0.005\n",

    "- B = 4\n",
    "- G = 0.2\n",
    "- C = Y - G\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these numbers is chosen deliberately so the model resembles core features of the U.S. economy. Output Y is normalized to 1 simply for convenience—this has no economic meaning and only sets the scale for the model. The real interest rate r=0.005 corresponds to roughly a 2 percent annual return after inflation, which is consistent with long-run data for safe assets like government bonds. Total household assets A=20 reflect the fact that U.S. households hold an enormous amount of wealth—around five times annual GDP—and the model expresses this ratio on a quarterly scale. Government debt B=4 corresponds to roughly 100 percent of annual GDP. Government spending G=0.2 represents a typical U.S. government spending share of about 20 percent of GDP. Consumption C is then set as the difference between output and government spending, implying that households consume 80 percent of output in steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the steady state, tax revenue must cover two components: government spending and interest payments on the outstanding debt. This follows directly from the government budget constraint. The model therefore computes: tax = G + r*B. This means the government collects 22 percent of GDP in revenue: 20 percent to finance government purchases and 2 percent to cover interest payments on the debt. This simple calculation ensures that the government budget is balanced and that there is no ongoing accumulation or reduction of debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Households in the model hold two types of assets: government bonds and shares in firms (equity). Asset-market equilibrium requires that the total value of these assets equals total household wealth. The model enforces this using: j = A - B. Since households hold  A=20 in total wealth and B=4 is government debt, the remaining  j=16 must represent the total market value of firms. This step ensures that the model assigns the correct amount of equity wealth to households.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next objective is to determine the markup that firms charge—i.e., how much higher prices are compared to production costs. Firms in the model pay out all of their profits in the form of dividends. If the total value of shares is p=j, then the no-arbitrage condition implies that the present value of dividends must equal this equity value. The notebook computes the after-tax dividends implied by the interest rate and equity value: div_post = r * j and div = div_post / (1 - tax). The first line states that the value of dividends must equal the required return on equity. The second line “undoes” taxes to find the pre-tax dividend amount. Once pre-tax dividends are known, the model determines the implied markup using: mu = 1 / (1 - div). This formula reflects the fact that pre-tax wages equal 1/μ in this model. Solving for μ yields a markup of about 11 percent, which is consistent with empirical estimates for advanced economies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once dividends are determined, the model computes after-tax wage income using: w_post = (1 - tax) * (1 - div). This represents the portion of output that accrues to workers after taxes and after subtracting pre-tax dividends. Given the earlier assumptions, households receive roughly 70 percent of output as after-tax labor income.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the wage Phillips curve consistent in steady state, the model must also ensure that the marginal disutility of working equals the marginal benefit of earning income. This requires choosing a parameter called vscale that scales the disutility of working. With log utility for consumption (eis = 1) and a labor supply elasticity of one (frisch = 1), the model computes: vscale = w_post / C**(1/eis) / Y**(1/frisch). This choice ensures that inflation is zero in steady state, which is the standard normalization in New Keynesian models."

By analyzing these dependencies, combine() constructs a complete “map” of the model. Second, it orders the blocks so that they can be evaluated in the correct sequence, from exogenous variables to final equilibrium conditions. This ensures that each block receives the information it needs. Third, it constructs the derivative and Jacobian machinery needed to solve the model. Blocks marked with @sj.simple automatically produce analytical derivatives through the toolkit’s autodifferentiation system, while more complex blocks—like those describing heterogeneous households—provide precomputed Jacobians. These mathematical objects are essential for Newton-type solvers that compute steady states and impulse responses. Finally, the function packages everything into a single model object.

The solver then proceeds in two major steps. First, it computes the optimal behavior of each household. This involves solving a dynamic programming problem, which determines how much each household wants to consume or save for every possible combination of income and wealth. The solver performs backward iteration: it starts with an initial guess for the value of future savings and repeatedly updates this guess until the values and associated decisions stabilize. Second, the model computes the steady-state distribution of households. It simulates how households move across income and asset states over many periods, given their optimal choices and the probabilities governing income changes. Over time, this process converges to a stable distribution, meaning that the fraction of households in each state remains constant. Finally, the model aggregates all household decisions and checks that markets clear—for example, that total household wealth equals the value of equity plus government debt.

    "Before studying how a tax policy shock affects inequality over time, it is useful to measure inequality at the steady state, that is, in the long-run equilibrium before any shock occurs. In heterogeneous-agent macroeconomic models, individuals differ by their asset holdings and income states, and these differences generate a cross-sectional distribution of wealth. From this distribution, we can compute widely used inequality statistics such as the Gini coefficient and the top 10% wealth share.\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct these measures, we retrieve the model’s stationary wealth distribution and the corresponding asset grid. The distribution tells us how many households are located at each point of the asset grid, while the asset grid lists the actual wealth levels associated with each point. Using these two objects, we can compute how wealth is distributed in the economy and how unequally it is held.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below first extracts the steady-state distribution and the asset grid from the model. It then defines a function, compute_inequality_metrics, which takes this distribution as input and returns the Gini coefficient and top 10% wealth share. The Gini coefficient summarizes overall inequality, ranging from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (maximum inequality). The top 10% wealth share measures what fraction of total wealth is owned by the richest 10% of households.\n",
    "\n",
    "After defining this function, we apply it to the steady-state distribution to compute and print the baseline levels of inequality. These baseline values serve as our reference point before the tax shock is introduced. Later in the notebook, we will compare these values to inequality after the shock, allowing us to evaluate how fiscal policy affects the distribution of wealth."

    "The heterogeneous-agent (HA) version of the model is far more complex than the representative-agent and two-agent versions because it tracks many types of households who differ in their income, savings, discount factors, and asset positions. When these households experience a change in wages, employment, or interest rates, their consumption and savings respond in complicated ways over time. These responses are essential for understanding how fiscal and monetary policy operate in the full model.\n",

    "A Jacobian, in this context, is simply a table that records how households respond to small changes in certain economic variables. For example, if the after-tax wage rises slightly in period 5, the Jacobian tells us how much household consumption will change in period 5, but also in periods 6, 7, 8, and so on. These responses include:\n",
    "- the immediate increase in spending when income rises,\n",

    "Once the fiscal shock and the steady states of the different models have been computed, the next task is to calculate how each model responds over time to the temporary, debt-financed tax cut. Figure 2(a) of the paper compares the responses of three economies: one with full household heterogeneity (HA), one with two types of households (TA), and one with a representative household (RA). Although these economies share the same firms, government, and financial markets, they react very differently to fiscal policy because their households behave differently. This section explains how the notebook computes these responses using the following code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function solve_impulse_linear is the toolkit’s main method for computing impulse responses—how the economy evolves over time after a small shock. Although the function appears compact, it performs several sophisticated steps in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the solver linearizes each model around its steady state. This means it computes how small changes in variables (like debt or output) affect the rest of the system. Linearization turns the model into a tractable system of equations that describes how deviations from the steady state unfold over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the solver imposes the path of the fiscal shock. In this case, the government debt deviations {dB_t} constructed earlier are fed into the model as an exogenous input. The government chooses this debt path, and the rest of the economy must adjust to make markets clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key variable that must adjust is output, denoted Y. The solver therefore treats output as an unknown sequence to be determined. To find this sequence, the solver enforces the asset market–clearing condition, which states that total household assets must equal the total value of equity and government bonds. This condition is applied in every period over the 400-quarter horizon, forming a system of 400 equations that ensure that households’ savings decisions remain consistent with the financial assets available in the economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A crucial part of this computation comes from the pre-computed household Jacobians, which summarize how households adjust their consumption and savings in response to changes in income, employment, and interest rates. By providing these Jacobians through the argument Js=Js, the solver avoids the need to recompute household dynamics from scratch, dramatically speeding up the overall computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solver then uses a version of Newton’s method, an iterative numerical algorithm, to find the output path that satisfies all equilibrium conditions. It begins with an initial guess, computes the implied market-clearing residuals, updates its guess using the Jacobians, and repeats until the residuals are essentially zero. This procedure typically converges in only a few iterations.\n",

Poorer households typically spend a large fraction of any extra income they receive, whereas wealthier households tend to save most of it. As a result, shifting the burden of taxation toward the rich can dramatically change the way fiscal policy propagates through the economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this experiment, we modify the fiscal block of the model so that all taxes above their steady-state level are charged exclusively to the richest income group. The code accomplishes this by copying the list of model blocks and replacing the usual fiscal function with an alternative version, fiscal_richest, which assigns all deviations in tax revenue to the top of the income distribution."

    "In this part of the notebook, we study how the heterogeneous-agent (HA) model behaves when monetary policy follows an active Taylor rule. Up to now, we have mostly treated the real interest rate as fixed over time. This is a convenient starting point, because it isolates the pure effects of fiscal policy. However, in reality, central banks react to inflation: when inflation rises, they usually raise nominal interest rates, and when inflation falls, they often cut rates. The Taylor rule is a simple mathematical way to describe this behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that the central bank chooses a nominal interest rate it that moves around a “neutral” or “target” real interest rate rt. If inflation is high, the rule tells the central bank to raise the nominal interest rate more than one-for-one with inflation, so that the real rate also increases and cools down the economy. In the code, this is captured by the parameter phi, which measures how aggressively the central bank responds to inflation. A value phi = 1.5 means that when inflation rises by one percentage point, the nominal rate rises by 1.5 percentage points, so the real rate also goes up.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this in the model, we first construct a modified steady state dictionary called ss_taylor. This dictionary contains all the steady-state values of the variables and parameters, just as in the baseline HA model, but we additionally specify two new parameters for the Taylor rule: phi, the strength of the reaction to inflation, and rstar, the target real interest rate around which the central bank wants the real rate to fluctuate. The steady state itself remains the same as in the baseline case: inflation is zero and the real rate equals r, so we are simply telling the model how the central bank will behave when the economy is pushed away from this steady state by a shock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we build a new model object model_ha_taylor using sj.combine. This combines all the “common” building blocks (production, bonds, fiscal policy, equity pricing, New Keynesian Phillips curve, market clearing, and the household block) and adds one more block, taylor_rule, which determines how the promised real rate responds to inflation. In this new setup, the real interest rate is no longer an externally fixed parameter but an endogenous variable that reacts to the model’s own inflation dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we call solve_impulse_linear on this extended model. Compared to the earlier experiments, there are two important differences. First, the list of unknowns now contains two variables, ['Y', 'pi'], because the model must jointly solve for both the path of output and the path of inflation. Second, the list of target equations now includes both the asset market clearing condition ('asset_mkt') and the New Keynesian Phillips curve residual ('nkpc_res'). In other words, the solution must find sequences for output and inflation such that both markets clear and the wage-inflation equation is satisfied in every period.\n",
    "\n",
    "We keep the same fiscal shock as before by feeding the previously constructed debt path dB as an exogenous input. The argument outputs=['Y'] tells the solver that we only want it to return the impulse response of output, and we extract this from the result using ['Y'] at the end. The pre-computed household Jacobians Js are still valid, because the behaviour of individual households has not changed: only the way the real interest rate is determined at the aggregate level is different. The result is an output response irf_B_taylor that reflects a deficit-financed tax cut in an economy where the central bank actively raises interest rates in response to inflation, rather than keeping the real rate fixed."

    "In this experiment we change how fiscal policy reacts to debt. Instead of telling the government what path its debt Bt must follow and letting taxes adjust, we now do the opposite: we tell the government what path its tax rate should follow and let debt be whatever is needed to satisfy the budget constraint. This is often called an “ALW rule,” after Angeletos, Lian, and Wolf, who study fiscal policy in models where the tax rate itself is the policy instrument.\n",

This array describes a temporary tax cut that is large at the beginning and then gradually fades out. The model then has to determine two things period by period. First, it must find the path for aggregate output Yt such that markets clear. Second, it must find the path for government debt Bt, such that the actual tax rate implied by the government budget constraint matches the exogenous tax rate path we imposed. When this happens, the residual variable tax_rate_res is equal to zero, so the tax rate rule is exactly satisfied.\n",

    "Technically, we implement this by calling the sequence-space solver solve_impulse_linear on the heterogeneous-agent model models['ha']. We ask the solver to treat both output Yt and debt Bt as unknown sequences to be determined. We impose two conditions that must hold in every period. The first condition is the asset market clearing equation asset_mkt = 0, which says that the assets households want to hold must equal the value of government bonds plus equity. The second condition is tax_rate_res = 0, which says that the tax rate produced endogenously by the fiscal block must coincide with the exogenous tax-rate shock we fed into the model. We provide the steady state ss['ha'], the tax-rate shock dT_shock, and the precomputed household Jacobians Js so that the solver can quickly find the linearized impulse response. The method then returns the whole time path of output Yt under this ALW tax-rate rule, and we store that path in the variable irf_B_ALW."

    "In this section, we want to construct an impulse response function (IRF) that shows how wealth inequality evolves after a deficit-financed tax cut. Ideally, we would like to follow the full distribution of wealth across all households over time and recompute exact inequality measures (such as the Gini coefficient and the wealth share of the top 10%) at each quarter. However, in this notebook we work with a simplified approach: instead of tracking the entire distribution period by period, we use the dynamics of aggregate assets in the heterogeneous-agent model as a proxy for how wealth becomes more or less concentrated over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point is the IRF for aggregate assets At produced by the heterogeneous-agent (HA) model. We ask the model how total wealth in the economy responds each quarter after the tax shock, under general equilibrium. Technically, we solve for the path of output Yt that makes the asset market clear in every period while we feed in the government debt shock Bt . The model then returns the time path of aggregate assets At. This gives us a sequence of numbers describing how much total wealth in the economy deviates from its steady-state level after the policy change.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper we are trying to replicate emphasizes a “trickling up” mechanism. Right after the tax cut, many households—rich and poor—temporarily increase their savings, so total wealth in the economy rises. Over time, households with high marginal propensities to consume (typically poorer households) spend down these additional savings faster, while households with low marginal propensities to consume (typically richer households) hold onto a larger share of the extra wealth. Even though total wealth At might remain elevated relative to its pre-shock level, it gradually becomes more concentrated in the hands of richer households. Inequality increases not because total wealth explodes forever, but because a growing fraction of that wealth is held at the top of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our code captures this story in a reduced-form way. First, we convert the aggregate-asset IRF into a simple measure of “extra wealth in the system” by computing the percentage deviation of At from its steady-state value Ass. This gives us a time series showing how much additional wealth has been generated by the stimulus and is still circulating in the economy at each quarter. We then make the approximation that standard inequality measures—such as the Gini coefficient and the top-10% wealth share—move proportionally with this extra wealth, because that additional wealth is gradually reallocated toward rich, low-MPC households.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this, we start from the baseline inequality measures computed at the steady state: a steady-state Gini coefficient and a steady-state top-10% wealth share. We then scale these baseline levels by a factor that depends on the percentage deviation of aggregate assets from steady state. This produces approximate time paths Ginit and Top10t that embody the idea that more extra wealth, held increasingly by the top, translates into higher inequality. Finally, we express these paths as percentage deviations from their steady-state values, which is the usual IRF format: we look at how many percent the Gini or top-10% share is above (or below) its long-run level at each quarter after the shock. The resulting IRFs are not exact distributional dynamics, but they provide an interpretable and transparent proxy for the evolution of wealth inequality driven by the “trickling up” mechanism in the model."
