# Aucler_Rognlie_Straub_2025_Hank_Replication
We replicate core results from: Adrien Auclert, Matthew Rognlie, and Ludwig Straub, "Fiscal and Monetary Policy with Heterogeneous Agents," NBER Working Paper 32991 (2024), https://doi.org/10.3386/w32991.

This repository contains a small `sequence_jacobian` implementation of a Heterogeneous-Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model, together with simpler two-agent (TANK) and representative-agent (RA) benchmarks. The code is organized around a single Jupyter notebook that:

- constructs the household blocks (HA, TANK, RA),
- builds the general equilibrium environment (production, fiscal, asset pricing, Phillips curve, monetary policy),
- calibrates the models to a simple steady state,
- and then runs fiscal experiments designed to mirror Figure 2 in Auclert–Rognlie–Straub (2024).

In addition, the notebook computes several inequality measures and their impulse responses.
